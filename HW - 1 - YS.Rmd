```{r setup, include=FALSE}
### Setting it up

library(readxl)
Typical_Employee_Survey_Data <- read_excel("C:/Users/pro10/Downloads/Typical_Employee_Survey_Data.xlsx", col_names = FALSE)

### Playing with original
View(Typical_Employee_Survey_Data)
names(Typical_Employee_Survey_Data)

### 1) Add Header Row (10 points)
TE <- data.frame(Typical_Employee_Survey_Data)
colnames(TE)

colnames(TE) <- c("Age", "Gender", "Satisfaction", "Jobcharact", "Yearsworked", "Promotion", "Decisions", "Budgetary", "Proud", "Alternative", "Relations")



### 2) Print out the 5-point summary and boxplot (numerical columns) for each column (20 points)

summary(TE$Age)
boxplot(TE$Age)

summary(TE$Gender)
boxplot(TE$Gender)

summary(TE$Satisfaction)
boxplot(TE$Satisfaction)

summary(TE$Jobcharact)
boxplot(TE$Jobcharact)

summary(TE$Yearsworked)
boxplot(TE$Yearsworked)

summary(TE$Promotion)
boxplot(TE$Promotion)

summary(TE$Decisions)
boxplot(TE$Decisions)

summary(TE$Budgetary)
boxplot(TE$Budgetary)

summary(TE$Proud)
boxplot(TE$Proud)

summary(TE$Alternative)
boxplot(TE$Alternative)

summary(TE$Relations)
boxplot(TE$Relations)



### 3) Convert the columns that need to be converted to Factors (10 points)

factor
factor(TE$Yearsworked)

lapply(TE$Yearsworked, factor)

str(TE$Yearsworked)

#(what didn't work in this question)
#TE[TE$Gender == 1] <- "Male"
#Error in `[<-.data.frame`(`*tmp*`, TE$Gender == 1, value = "Male") : duplicate subscripts for columns
#TE$Gender <- factor(TE$Gender,levels = c(0,1), labels=c("female","male")
#TE$Gender <- factor(TE$Gender,levels = c(0,1), labels=c("female","male"))
#Error: unexpected symbol in: "TE"

#what worked (changed 1 and 0 to male female)
TE$Gender[TE$Gender == 1] <- "Male"
TE$Gender[TE$Gender == 2] <- "Female"

#changed do you participate in budgetary decisions 1 yes 2 no 
TE$Budgetary[TE$Budgetary == 1] <- "I participate in budg. dec."
TE$Budgetary[TE$Budgetary == 2] <- "I don't participate in budg. dec."



### 4) Plot the right visual for each column (20 points)

barplot(TE$Age)
hist(TE$Age) #hist is better

table(TE$Gender)
barplot(table(TE$Gender))

hist(TE$Satisfaction)

hist(TE$Jobcharact)

hist(TE$Yearsworked)
plot(TE$Yearsworked)

hist(TE$Promotion)
boxplot(TE$Promotion)

boxplot(TE$Decisions)
hist(TE$Decisions)

barplot(table(TE$Budgetary))

hist(TE$Proud)
boxplot(TE$Proud)

hist(TE$Alternative)
boxplot(TE$Alternative)

hist(TE$Relations)
boxplot(TE$Relations)



### 5) Plot scatter plots to show few relationships (20 points)

scatter.smooth(TE$Age, TE$Yearsworked)
scatter.smooth(TE$Yearsworked, TE$Alternative)
scatter.smooth(TE$Yearsworked, TE$Satisfaction)

scatter.smooth(TE$Age, TE$Relations)
scatter.smooth(TE$Promotion, TE$Satisfaction)

plot(TE$Age, TE$Yearsworked)
```
